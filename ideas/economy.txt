Economy

there needs to be some form of currency, I would like three distinct types representative of the nation, with currency exchange rates that could fluctuate based off of one nations attitudes towards another.

Example;
kingdom 
copper piece = 1
silver piece= 10 copper
gold  piece= 100 copper or 10 silver
platinum piece = 1000 copper or 100 silver or 10 gold


caliphate
Bronze Bit = 1
Bronze Drachma = 10
Silver Dirhim = 100
Gold Dinar = 1000
 
empire
Tsuho  Coin = 1
Genbo Coin = 10
Shoho Coin = 100
Mon  Coin = 1000

need a banking system so that players can store money in the bank 
need a vault system so that players can store items in a personal vault
