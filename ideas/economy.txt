Economy

there needs to be some form of currency, I would like three distinct types representative of the nation, with currency
exchange rates that could fluctuate based off of one nations attitudes towards another.

Example;
kingdom 
copper piece = 1
silver piece= 10 copper
gold  piece= 100 copper or 10 silver
platinum piece = 1000 copper or 100 silver or 10 gold


caliphate
brass bit = 1
bronze drachma = 10 bits
silver dirhim = 100 bits or 10 Drachma
gold dinar = 1000 = 1000 Bits or 100 Drachma or 10 Dirhim
 
empire
tsuho  Coin = 1
genbo Coin = 10 tsuho
shoho Coin = 100 tsuho or 10 genbo
mon  Coin = 1000 tsuho or 100 genbo or 10 Shoho
