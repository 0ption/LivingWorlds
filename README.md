# Welcome to Living Worlds: Mercadia!

Overview

Mercadia is a world that hopefully will be semi dynamic or living world based upon character involvement in various aspects of game world at large. 

there are plans for it to have three main nations, each offering a different style of roleplay and ease of play ranging from easy to challenging.

Each nation will have races unique to that enviroment and only able to be played by starting in that location, with humans being common to all three, 

the guilds for the most part will represent a character class but also set a certain style of roleply based on that guilds role within the nation it exists in. Only people who have fealty to the nation the guild resides in can become part of one of those guilds, changing fealty is something that is going to be difficult to do but ultimatly allowed at a later time. certain guilds will be universal however, most notably clerics and paladins, which are not unique to any one nation but rather to one of the gods of the world.  joinging a guild is done through roleplay based on the criteria that is set up by the guilds individually, tasking of sorts.

all players will start their characters as a commoner class, and must seek out one of the various guilds of their nation to eventually be able to move forward past a certain point.

more to come.
